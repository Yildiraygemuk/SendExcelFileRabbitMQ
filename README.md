<h4>Send Email the Excel file with Rabbitmq </h4>
I created a basic application that is built in a layered architecture in accordance with SOLID principles and makes it easy to reach endpoints with swagger. The main purpose here is to get the e-mail address of the requesting user to retrieve data from the database and send it to the queue as a message. The subscriber listening to the queue receives this e-mail address, creates the desired data in an excel file and sends it by e-mail.
